* SPI-based USB host controller Maxim Integrated max3421e

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "maxim,max3421"
- reg: chip select number to which the max3421 chip is connected
  (depends on master SPI controller)
- spi-max-frequency: the operational frequency, must not exceed <26000000>
- interrupt-parent: phandle of the associated GPIO controller to which the INT line
  of max3421e chip is connected
- interrupts: specification of the GPIO pin (in terms of the `interrupt-parent`)
  to which INT line of max3421e chip is connected.
  The driver configures MAX3421E for active low level triggered interrupts.
  Configure your 'interrupt-parent' gpio controller accordingly.
- vbus: <GPOUTx ACTIVE_LEVEL>
  GPOUTx is the number (1-8) of GPOUT pin of max3421e used to drive Vbus.
  ACTIVE_LEVEL is 1 or 0.

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-names
- pinctrl-0
  Associated pin control, see binding information for the pinctrl nodes

Not yet implemented but planned properties:
- gpx-gpio: <gpio_phandle gpio_pin active_level>
  the phandle of the GPIO controller to which GPX pin of max3421e is connected,
  the number of gpio pin on the controller to which GPX is connected
  the active level of GPX pin on the GPIO controller
- reset-gpio: <gpio_phandle gpio_pin active_level>
  the phandle of the GPIO controller to which #RES pin of max3421e is connected,
  the number of gpio pin on the controller to which #RES is connected
  the active level of #RES pin on the GPIO controller
- oc-flag (optional): <GPINx ACTIVE_LEVEL>
  GPINx is the number (1-8) of the GPIN pin of max3421 where the overcurrent flag
  line is connected (e.g. from max4793 as in max3421evkit-1+ evaluation kit)
  ACTIVE_LEVEL is 1 or 0
- gpio-controller: empty property to enable exporting as GPIOs of otherwise
  unused GPIN and GPOUT pins of max3421e.
