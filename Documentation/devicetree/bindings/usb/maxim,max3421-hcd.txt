* SPI-based USB host controller Maxim Integrated max3421e

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "maxim,max3421"
- reg: chip select number to which the max3421 chip is connected
  (depends on master SPI controller)
- spi-max-frequency: the operational frequency, must not exceed <26000000>
- interrupt-parent: phandle of the associated GPIO controller to which the INT line
  of max3421e chip is connected
- interrupts: specification of the GPIO pin (in terms of the `interrupt-parent`)
  to which INT line of max3421e chip is connected.
  The driver configures MAX3421E for active low level triggered interrupts.
  Configure your 'interrupt-parent' gpio controller accordingly.
- vbus: <GPOUTx ACTIVE_LEVEL>
  GPOUTx is the number (1-8) of GPOUT pin of max3421e used to drive Vbus.
  ACTIVE_LEVEL is 1 or 0.

Don't forget to add pinctrl properties if you need some GPIO pins reconfigured
for use as INT. See binding information for the pinctrl nodes.
